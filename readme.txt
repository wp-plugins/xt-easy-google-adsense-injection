[XT Easy Google Adsense Injection WordPress Plugin](http://xtthemes.com/xt-easy-google-adsense-injection/ "XT Easy Google Adsense Injection WordPress plugin Link at xtthemes.com") XT Easy Google Adsense Injection
Is an easy to use plugin that makes placing Google Adsense or Affiliate Adverts to your posts, pages and sidebar extremely easy. It works by using short-codes that work efficiently with current themes template files.

I wrote this plugin with simplicity in mind, nothing is over-complicated with this plugin. It has been created to be easy and quick to use, by Wordpress users, of any level of experience. 

With this Google Adsense plugin, you can store up to five Adsense codes and just use these whenever needed. If you need to use a different code, for any reason, just delete your existing Adsense code and paste in a new code, simple.

This plugin is versatile, in that you do not just have to use Google Adsense codes you can place other ads as well, including affiliate codes.
